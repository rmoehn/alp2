"""
        You only have to write some code inside the 'decide_color' functions.
        Your decide_color functions calculate a color for each (x,y) position
        and give it back with a return statement.
        The 'six 'decide_color' functions are called in the 'Mosaic_GUI.py'
        script to paint the six mosaics in a window.
        For an easy start we wrote some simple examples.
        Please overwrite them with your own solutions.
        
        Both files have to be in the same directory and you must run the 
        'Mosaic_GUI.py' script to show your mosaics.
        
        In the following page you can find a table of colors to be used
        in your functions
